=head1 NAME

Reaction::UI::ViewPort::Role::Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role to ease attaching actions to L<Reaction::InterfaceModel::Object>s

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 actions

Read-only, lazy-building ArrayRef of URI objects pointing to actions.

=head2 action_prototypes

A HashRef of prototypes for building the Action links. The prototypes should be
composed like these:

    my %action_prototypes = (
      example_action => { label => 'Example Action', uri => $uri_obj },
    );

    #or you can get fancy and do something like what is below:
    sub make_label{
      my($im, $ctx) =  @_; #InterfaceModel::Object/Collection, Catalyst Context
      return 'label_text';
    }
    sub make_uri{
      my($im, $ctx) =  @_; #InterfaceModel::Object/Collection, Catalyst Context
      return return $ctx->uri_for('some_action');
    }
    my %action_prototypes = (
      example_action => { label => \&make_label, uri => \&make_uri },
    );

=head2 action_order

User-provided ArrayRef with how the actions should be ordered eg

     action_order => [qw/view edit delete/]

=head2 computed_action_order

Read-only lazy-building ARRAY ref. The final computed action order. This may
differ from the C<action_order> provided if you any actions were not included
in that list.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 _build_actions

Cycle through the C<computed_action_order> and create a new
L<ViewPort::URI|Reaction::UI::ViewPort::URI> object for each action using the
provided prototypes.

=head2 _build_computed_action_order

Compute the final action ordering by using the provided C<action_order> as a
spec to order all the present actions (the keys of C<action_prototypes>)

=head1 ACTION PROTOTYPES

Action prototypes are simply hashrefs that must contain a C<uri> key and may
contain a C<label> key. The label can be anything that the display attribute of
L<ViewPort::URI|Reaction::UI::ViewPort::URI> will accept, usually a scalar or a
ViewPort. The value for C<uri> may be either a scalar, a L<URI> object (or
anything that C<ISA URI>).

Additionally, both C<label> and C<uri> can be CODE refs. In this case, the code
will be executed at C<_build_actions> time and will recieve two arguments, the
value returned by C<model> and the value returned by C<ctx> in that order. Both
of these methods should be implemented in the consuming class. By convention,
model refers to the target of the action, an C<InterfaceModel::Object> in the
case of a member action and an C<InterfaceModel::Collection> in the case of a
Collection action. C<ctx> should be the current Catalyst context.
