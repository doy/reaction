Reaction::Manual::Intro - Introduction to Reaction

=head1 INTRODUCTION

Reaction is basically an extended MVC:

=over

=item Domain Model 

DBIx::Class::Schema, MyApp::Foo, MyApp::Bar, etc.

=item Interface Model 

InterfaceModel::DBIC::Schema, InterfaceModel::Action,
MyApp::InterfaceModel::Foo classes.

=item Controller 

Mediation and navigation.

=item ViewPort

Event handling encapsulation.

=item Widget

View logic.

=item Renderer 

MyApp::View:: classes, renders viewports.

=head1 THE REACTION WAY

The idea is you separate your domain model, which encapsulates the domain
itself from your interface model, which is a model of how a particular app or
class of apps interact with that domain and provides objects/methods to
encapsulate the common operations it does.

=head2 Domain Models vs Interface Models

Domain models are expected to drive the application business logic and data.
All domain models that need to be effectively displayed somehow at the user
interface (a table, for instance) must interact with an interface model.
These should provide the common methods needed in order to carry out
user-generated events.

=head1 SETTING UP A REACTION APPLICATION

Reaction applications are set up just like Catalyst:

    $ catalyst.pl MyApp
    # output ommited
    $ cd MyApp

=head2 Models

Reaction provides a reflector component which automagically
maps a L<DBIx::Class::Schema> into a set of Interface Models which can be used
by Reaction to build the interface components. If you're not familiar with
L<DBIx::Class> or don't have a schema handy, now is a good time to go through
L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Intro> to get a schema set up.

    package MyApp::InterfaceModel::DBIC;

    use base 'Reaction::InterfaceModel::Object';
    use Reaction::InterfaceModel::Reflector::DBIC;

    my $reflector = Reaction::InterfaceModel::Reflector::DBIC->new;

    $reflector->reflect_schema(
         model_class  => __PACKAGE__,
         schema_class => 'MyApp::Schema',
         sources => [qw/Foo Baz/],
    );

    1;

=head2 Controllers

Your Reaction application must have a Root controller which inherits from
C<Reaction::UI::Controller::Root>.

    package MyApp::Controller::Root;

    use warnings;
    use strict;
    use base qw/Reaction::UI::Controller::Root/;

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        view_name => 'Site',
        window_title => 'My Reaction App',
        namespace => ''
    );
