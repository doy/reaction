  # consider supporting slice, first, iterator, last etc.
  # pager functionality should probably be a role

  # IM objects don't have write methods because those are handled through actions,
  # no support for write actions either unless someone makes a good case for it
  # many models may not even be writable, so we cant make that assumption...

  # I feel like we should hasa result_class or object_class ?
  # having this here would remove a lot of PITA complexity from
  # ObjectClass and SchemaClass when it comes to munging with internals

  #Answer: No, because collections should be able to hold more than one type of object

  # ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE TO ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE BEHAVIOR ONLY. DON'T CONSIDER
  # THEM CORRECT, OR FINAL. JUST A ROUGH DRAFT.

=head1 NAME

Reaction::InterfaceModel::Collection - Generic collections of
L<Reaction::InterfaceModel::Object>s

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The base class for C<InterfaceModel::Collection>s. The functionality implemented here
is minimal and it is expected that specialized collections be built by sublclassing
this and exploiting the roles system.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 members

Returns a list containing all known members of the collection

=head2 add_member $object

Will add the object passed to the collection

=head2 remove_member $object

Removed the object passed from the collection, if present

=head2 count_members

Returns the number of objects in the collection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 _collection_store

Read-write & lazy_build. Holds the arrayref where the collection of objects is
presently stored. Has a clearer of C<_clear_collection_store> and a predicate of
 C<_has_collection_store>.

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS

_build__collection_store

Builder method for attribute_collection_store, returns an empty arrayref

=head1 AUTHORS

See L<Reaction::Class> for authors.

=head1 LICENSE

See L<Reaction::Class> for the license.
